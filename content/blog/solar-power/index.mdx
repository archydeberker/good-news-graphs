The price of solar has undergone an astonishing decline since the 1990s.

In this plot, we compare **the price of solar energy** to **how much solar power is installed** for each country.
The animation shows the fall in price as more solar power is installed.

Installing **new** solar is now cheaper than running **existing** coal
plants in some regions of China.

The low price in China and India is particularly encouraging, because lots
of new energy capacity will be needed there in the next decade.
