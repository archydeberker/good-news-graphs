## What will I learn?

1. What is a model?

2. Why would I need one?

3. What does it mean for a model to learn?

## Who needs a model, anyway?

Many problems in the real world have the form:

<h6>
  I have a bunch of numbers and I'd like them to be mapped to another number
</h6>
It's helpful to label these as <Input>inputs</Input> (the numbers you have) and <Output>
  outputs
</Output> (the numbers you want).

A model is simply an algorithm that helps us perform that mapping, from Input => Output.[^1]

Some examples:

- I have the <Input> speeds </Input> and locations of some parcels, and I need to know <Output> when they will arrive </Output>

- I have the <Input>mock exam results </Input>of some kids who can't sit their real exams due to COVID, I want to <Output> estimate their grades</Output>

- I have the <Input>weights of some puppies </Input> and I want to know <Output>how heavy they will be in 12 weeks time</Output>

Although it's not immediately obvious, there are many other problems of this form, because computers understand _everything_ as numbers,
and so stuff that we wouldn't consider numbers are also just numbers to a computer:

- Is this a <Input> photo </Input> of an <Output>Alsatian or a Corgi </Output>(_images are numbers_)
- Is this <Input>email </Input>a <Output>complaint or an enquiry</Output> about a booking (_words are numbers_)
- I've got a <Input>recording of Don't Stop Me Now </Input>, I'd like a <Output>version without the singing for karaoke </Output> (_sounds are numbers_)

We'll return to this topic - how can we map everything onto numbers so that computers can understand it - in lesson 3. For now,
you're going to have to take my word for it.

For now, let's return to those puppies, because they're adorable. And because I recently had to book a transatlanic flight for a rapidly
growing puppy, so I needed to figure out how much he was likely to weigh when we took the flight.

<Scatter line={false} />

In this case, what I have - the input - is the <Input> age of the dog </Input> and what I want - the output - is the <Output> weight </Output>.

Squinting at this graph, you can see there's a relationship here, right? And if we were to try and draw that relationship, it might look something like this:

<Scatter line={true} />

This line is a model!

It describe show to map our input onto an output. Given an <Input> Age </Input> we can use the line to estimate the <Output> Weight </Output>.

Most models can be represented like this: as a visual relationship between inputs and outputs. But they also have a mathematial definition, which is
how computers understand them.

This line represents a model called "linear regression".

Why? _Linear_ means that our outputs are a weighted sum of our inputs, with no funny business,
and it's a _regression_ because what we're trying to predict (the <Output> Weight </Output> ) is a continuous number, rather than a discrete category.

Ok, brace yourself, here comes our first equation:

|----|-----|
| y| the output, what we're aiming for|

<EquationBox>
  <Output> y </Output> = m <Input> x </Input> + c
</EquationBox>
<Regression />

[^1]:
    I found this phrasing pretty confusing for a long time, because "modelling" usually means replicating a complex system (like the weather) in a simpler
    piece of maths. Similarly in biology, when we use a "model" organism, it's a simpler example of a system we care about (like a human) but that's easier to
    study and manipulate (like a fly). But in machine learning, we aren't usually trying to copy a system that exists: we're just trying to map from Inputs
    to Outputs.
